# Emotion Game
## A speedrunning game to type sentences that have a sense of the target emotion. An emotion classifying AI decides if you win or lose!

I used j-hartmann's [emotion-english-distilroberta-base](https://github.com/j-hartmann/emotion-english-distilroberta-base) as the emotion classification language model for classifying the users input.
I used Qt Designer and PySide for the GUI.
